# SuperPoint with Illumination Conditions Adaptation (ICA)

This repository provides an inference pipeline for a PyTorch implementation of the SuperPoint network, enhanced with the **Illumination Conditions Adaptation (ICA)** method. 
Showcases the research and some of the methods developed in the following papers:

- **Increasing Illumination Invariance of Learning-Based Features through Realistic Simulated Environments Adaptation**  
  DOI: [-/-] (submitted for publication)

- **Illumination Conditions Adaptation for Data-Driven Keypoint Detection under Extreme Lighting Variations**  
  DOI: [10.1109/IST59124.2023.10355736](https://doi.org/10.1109/IST59124.2023.10355736)

## Features

- **PyTorch Implementation of Superpoint:** 
  - Built upon existing SuperPoint implementations, based on the works of:
    - [Magicleap/SuperPointPretrainedNetwork](https://github.com/magicleap/SuperPointPretrainedNetwork) ([Original Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07629))
    - [Eric-yyjau/pytorch-superpoint](https://github.com/eric-yyjau/pytorch-superpoint)
    - [Rpautrat/SuperPoint](https://github.com/rpautrat/SuperPoint)
    
- **Photo-Realistic Synthetic Illumination (PRSI) Dataset:**
  - Day-to-night dataset created using Unreal Engine 5, featuring diverse environments, controlled lighting transformations, and precise camera poses. Created to guide ICA's training.

- **Illumination Conditions Adaptation (ICA):**
  - A novel technique leveraging day-time features as pseudo-ground truths for the training of night-time images.

- **Custom Night-KITTI Variants:**
  - Nighttime datasets generated using [img2img-turbo](https://github.com/GaParmar/img2img-turbo), LUTs, and OpenCV, including:
    - `night-kitti00`
    - `night-kitti06`
    - `dark-night-kitti06`

- **Evaluation Pipelines:** 
  - Benchmarked using:
    - [HPatches Benchmark](https://github.com/hpatches/hpatches-dataset)
    - [PySLAM Toolkit](https://github.com/luigifreda/pyslam)

- **Demo Visualization Script:** 
  - Includes `sp_inference.py` for quick testing and visualization of feature detection results.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
We tested the following 2 settings: 
- **Python** = 3.6 and 3.8
- **PyTorch** =1.7.1 and 2.1.2+cu121
- **OpenCV** =3.4.2 and 4.10
- **CUDA** 11.0 and 12.1

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sp-ica.git
    cd sp-ica

2. Run the demo (use --cuda to run with GPU requires CUDA):
   ```bash
    python3 sp_inference.py assets/kitti06.mp4 --cuda   
    python3 sp_inference.py assets/night-kitti06 --cuda
